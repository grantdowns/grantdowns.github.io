    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Below are some MIS related projects I have worked on as well as the dates they took place. These can also be found on my resume.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation of mock company "Packwood Ski Company's" database, Fall 2018 - A project for a database class at the University
        of Oklahoma. A company gave a list of requirements for a database being built. The database was built from the
        ground up, including the creation of the ERD, normalization of fields, and the actual creation of the database itself
        in Microsoft SQL Server with mock data.</li>
        <li>Creation of Tinker Airforce Base's Infrastructure and Building Database for MIS Field Project Spring 2019 - The MIS Field
        Project class has University of Oklahoma MIS students working with organizations on real projects. Tinker Airforce
        Base had asked the University of Oklahoma to create a database for their infrastructure data in order to
        run reports for high level management decisions. This would be a multi-semester long project. A Microsoft Access
        database was inherited from previous groups. This database was then transfered over to Microsoft SQL Server in order
        to meet with federal regulations as well be a foundation for Tableau to pull data from for reports for management.
        In addition to creating the database, work was started on creating the update process for the database using SQL Server Data Tools.
        </li>
        <li>Conversion of Modern Lithos Database, Summer 2019 (future assignment) - Tasked with converting Modern Litho's newly acquired company's 
        database to the software used by Modern Litho.</li>
    </ul>
