    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I began attending the University of Oklahoma in 2015. While my degree is in Management Information Systems,
    I have experience in other fields as well. I started off as a Chemical Engineering and Pre Medicine student when I
    initially enrolled in the University of Oklahoma. I eventually discovered I hated chemical engineering and switched
    into Price College of Business. After completing all of my Pre Medicine classes, I decided I had no desire to go to 
    school as long as it would take to become a doctor. The consequence of all this is a background in various mathematics
    and science courses above what the ordinary Management Information Systems student is required to take.</p>
